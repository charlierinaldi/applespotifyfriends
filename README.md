# applespotifyfriends
App to connect users on both Apple Music and Spotify, enabling them to share playlists in one hub

This will utilize both the Apple Music and Spotify APIs to host platform-neutral playlists and enable the downloading of friends' playlists to the desired platform.

This project is in early stages. The current step is successfully pulling desired playlists from both of the API's.
